This page gives hints on how to build a lattice model in anaddb



## Introduction
The lattice Wannier functions (LWF's) are localized functions of atomic displacements in crystal structures which are the analogue of electronic Wannier functions. They could be used as basis set of effective Hamiltonians for the description of lattice distortions. 

In anaddb, we can use the "selected cloumns of the density matrix" (SCDM-k) algorithm for the construction of the LWF's.
