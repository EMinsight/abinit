# Lattice Wannier function (LWF) model in MULTIBINIT


## Build a LWF model and run LWF dynamics in MULTIBINIT

This lesson aims at showing how to build a LWF model and run a spin dynamics calculation.

**Before beginning, we recommend the reading of the theory on Lattice Wannier functions in the literature [[cite:rabe1995]]. The construction of LWF from the phonon band structure is covered in another [[tutorial|lattice_wannier]]. 

With this lesson, you will learn to:

  * Run the dynamics of LWF.

*Before beginning, you might consider to work in a subdirectory for this tutorial. Why not Work_lwfdyn?*
